# Daily Game Report - 2026-02-05

## Research and brainstorming
- Re-reviewed the Breakout implementation for feel and fairness issues that would impact repeated play sessions.
- Focused on low-risk polish opportunities: readability of the wind twist, collision quality, and difficulty pacing.

## Selected concept
**Windbreaker Breakout** — a classic brick breaker where periodic gusts push the ball sideways.

## Revision summary after feedback
- Smoothed wind transitions by easing toward new wind targets instead of abrupt changes.
- Added a wind-shift countdown indicator for better player planning.
- Improved brick collision response by distinguishing side vs top/bottom rebounds.
- Added a mild speed ramp tied to score to improve late-round tension.

## MVP scope status
- Single-screen loop remains intact with score, lives, pause, and restart.
- Gameplay is now more predictable while preserving the wind twist challenge.
